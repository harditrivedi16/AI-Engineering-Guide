        "# Marketing Agent: Rule-Based AI for Promotional Content\n",
        "\n",
        "This project builds a rule-based AI agent that helps generate creative marketing content using a mix of prompt engineering and generative models.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Project Tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent supports the following three tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Product Description\n",
        "   - Given a product name, return a short marketing-friendly product description.\n",
        "   - Uses a pre-defined dictionary of products.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Marketing Image Generation (Text-to-Image)\n",
        "   - Given a product name, generate a promotional-style image using a DALL·E-like image generator.\n",
        "   - Uses prompt templates to describe the product visually.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Style Transfer for Marketing Image (Image-to-Image)\n",
        "   - Given a marketing image of product X and the name of product Y, generate a marketing image for Y that **preserves the style** of X.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Agent Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "We implement a rule-based agent that parses user input and routes it to the appropriate tool (function) based on task intent. This contrasts with LLM-based agents by using deterministic logic, making it ideal for simple logic to choose tools\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Learning Outcomes\n",
        "\n",
        "- Understand the structure of a hybrid AI system (dictionary lookup + generative tools)\n",
        "- Practice designing and testing prompts for image Generation Task\n",
        "- Learn to build and extend rule-based agents using simple routing logic\n",
        "- Evaluation using A/B testing\n"
